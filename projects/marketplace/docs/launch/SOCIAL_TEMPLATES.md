### Launch Tweet
```
🚀 Launching MyWork - where developers build, share, and sell.

Build with AI → Contribute to the Brain → Sell & keep 90%

Why 90%? Because App Store's 30% is robbery.

Free framework. Fair marketplace.

Try it: github.com/DansiDanutz/MyWork-AI
```

### Thread: The Problem
```
Why do developers' side projects die on GitHub? 🧵

1/ We can BUILD anything.

But monetizing? That's where it falls apart.

Let me explain...

2/ App stores take 30%.
Envato takes up to 37.5%.
Gumroad isn't built for developers.

The tools we use to build don't help us sell.

3/ So we have:
- Brilliant projects gathering dust
- Developers solving the same problems
- No path from "built it" to "earning from it"

4/ I built MyWork to fix this.

It's a framework + marketplace where:
- You build faster with AI
- You share knowledge (Brain gets smarter)
- You sell and keep 90%

5/ The secret is volume over margin.

10% fee means more sellers.
More sellers means more products.
More products means more buyers.
More buyers means more sales.

Everyone wins.

6/ Want to try it?

Framework is free & open source.
Selling requires Pro ($49/mo).

What would you build?

### Thread: Technical
```
How we built an AI "Brain" that gets smarter with every user 🧵

1/ Every developer faces the same problems.

Auth setup. API structure. Error handling.

Yet we solve them from scratch. Every. Single. Time.

What if there was collective memory?

2/ Introducing the Brain.

It's a vector database (Pinecone) connected to Claude AI.

When you solve a problem, the Brain learns.
When someone else has that problem, the Brain helps.

3/ How it works:

Step 1: Developer asks "How do I set up FastAPI auth?"
Step 2: Brain searches 1,300+ patterns
Step 3: Claude generates answer with context
Step 4: Developer's solution feeds back into Brain

4/ The magic: it compounds.

Day 1: 100 patterns
Month 1: 1,000 patterns
Year 1: 10,000+ patterns

Every project makes the next one easier.

5/ Technical stack:
- Embeddings: Claude API
- Vector DB: Pinecone
- Storage: PostgreSQL
- API: FastAPI

6/ This is why MyWork isn't "just another framework."

It's a learning system.

The more you use it, the better it gets.
For you AND everyone else.

### Launch Post
```
🚀 I'm launching something I wish existed when I started coding.

MyWork is an AI-powered development framework with a marketplace where developers keep 90% of their sales.

Why build this?

I've watched brilliant developers create amazing side projects that never see the light of day. Not because they're not good enough - but because monetization is HARD.

- App stores take 30%
- Code marketplaces take up to 37.5%
- There's no clear path from "built it" to "earning from it"

MyWork changes this:

✅ Open source framework (free forever)
✅ AI-assisted development
✅ Collective "Brain" that learns from everyone
✅ Marketplace with only 10% platform fee

The math is simple: if you sell a $299 project...
- On App Store: you keep $209
- On Envato: you keep $186-$261
- On MyWork: you keep $269

Who's it for?
- Indie developers with side projects
- Freelancers with reusable solutions
- Agencies building client work

I believe in volume over margin. More creators earning = bigger ecosystem = everyone wins.

Check it out: github.com/DansiDanutz/MyWork-AI

Would you sell your projects if you kept 90%?

#opensource #developers #startup #ai #marketplace
```

### Thought Leadership
```
Hot take: The 30% "platform tax" is killing developer creativity.

When Apple and Google take 30% of app sales, they're not just taking money.

They're taking:
- The motivation to ship side projects
- The incentive to build and share
- The dream of passive income from code

We've normalized this. We shouldn't.

That's why I built MyWork with a 10% fee. Yes, 10%.

"But how will you make money?"

Volume. If more developers sell because they keep more, everyone wins:
- Developers: More income
- Buyers: More options
- Platform: More transactions

This isn't charity. It's better business.

What would you build if you kept 90% of sales?

```
Title: Built a marketplace where devs keep 90% of sales (Show & Tell)

Hey everyone!

I just launched MyWork - it's an AI framework + marketplace where developers can sell their projects.

**The Problem I'm Solving:**
- I have projects on GitHub gathering dust
- Monetization options suck (30% app store fees, complex Gumroad setup)
- Same problems get solved repeatedly (no collective learning)

**The Solution:**
- Open source framework with AI assistance
- "Brain" that learns from everyone's solutions
- Marketplace where you keep 90% of sales

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind
- Backend: FastAPI, PostgreSQL
- AI: Claude, Pinecone
- Payments: Stripe Connect

**Business Model:**
- Free: Framework, basic Brain access
- Pro ($49/mo): Sell on marketplace, full Brain, analytics

**What I'd Love Feedback On:**
1. Does this solve a real problem for you?
2. Would you sell your projects here?
3. Is $49/mo reasonable for sellers?

GitHub: [link]

Happy to answer any questions!
```

### r/webdev Discussion
```
Title: What would it take for you to actually sell your side projects?

I've been thinking about this a lot lately.

So many of us build cool things but never monetize them. Why?

From my research:
- "Not polished enough" (perfectionism)
- "Don't know where to sell" (distribution)
- "Fees are too high" (economics)
- "Support seems like a nightmare" (time)

I'm building a marketplace specifically for developers (shameless plug: MyWork).

But I'm genuinely curious: what would make YOU comfortable selling your work?

- Lower fees?
- Built-in licensing?
- Anonymous option?
- Easy documentation tools?
- Community validation first?

Not trying to sell you anything - just want to understand the real blockers.

### Show HN Post

Title: Show HN: MyWork – Dev framework + marketplace (90% to creators)

I built a development framework with an integrated marketplace where creators keep 90% of sales.

The problem: Developers build amazing projects but monetizing them is hard. App stores take 30%, code marketplaces take up to 37.5%, and there's no clear path from GitHub repo to revenue.

MyWork is:
1. An AI-assisted framework (open source, free)
2. A collective "Brain" that learns from all users
3. A marketplace with 10% platform fee

Tech: Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Claude AI, Pinecone, Stripe Connect

Why 10% instead of 30%?

I'm betting that lower fees = more sellers = more products = more buyers = more total transactions. Volume over margin.

The Brain is the interesting part - it's a vector database that stores solutions. When you solve a problem, future developers benefit. Think Stack Overflow meets AI assistant.

GitHub: https://github.com/DansiDanutz/MyWork-AI

Would appreciate feedback. Specifically interested in:
- Does the 90% model make you more likely to sell?
- What would you want to sell?
- What's missing?
```

### Ask HN (for feedback)
```
Title: Ask HN: Would you sell your side projects if you kept 90%?

I'm building a marketplace for developers and trying to understand if pricing is the main blocker.

Current landscape:
- Apple/Google: 30% cut
- Envato: 12.5-37.5% cut
- Gumroad: 10% + payment processing

I'm considering 10% flat (includes payment processing cost).

Questions:
1. Is fee structure the main reason you don't sell projects?
2. If not fees, what IS the blocker?
3. What would a marketplace need to have for you to list something?

Building in public, genuine feedback appreciated.

### Tagline Options
```
Option 1: Build with AI. Share knowledge. Sell your projects.
Option 2: The developer marketplace where you keep 90%
Option 3: AI framework + marketplace for developer projects
Option 4: Where side projects become income
```

### First Comment
```
👋 Hey Product Hunt!

I'm [Name], and I built MyWork because I was tired of watching great developer projects die on GitHub.

THE PROBLEM:
We can build anything. But monetizing? That's where it falls apart.
- App stores take 30%
- Code marketplaces take up to 37.5%
- Setting up Gumroad is a hassle

THE SOLUTION:
MyWork is three things:
1. 🔧 An AI-powered development framework (free, open source)
2. 🧠 A "Brain" that learns from everyone's solutions
3. 💰 A marketplace where you keep 90% of sales

WHY 90%?
Because I believe creators deserve more. The math only works if we have volume - so the platform needs to be SO good that lots of people use it.

WHO IT'S FOR:
- Indie devs with side projects
- Freelancers with reusable code
- Anyone who's ever thought "I could sell this"

I'd love your feedback:
- Does this solve a real problem?
- What features would you want?
- What would you sell?

Thanks for checking it out! 🚀
