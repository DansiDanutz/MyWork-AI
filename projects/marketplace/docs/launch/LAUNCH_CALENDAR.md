## Week 3: Soft Launch (Dev Communities)

### Day 1: Reddit Soft Launch

**Subreddits (in order):**
| Subreddit | Members | Post Type |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| r/SideProject | 200K | "Launched my project" |
| r/webdev | 1.5M | Resource/tool |
| r/programming | 5M | Discussion (careful) |

**Reddit Post Template:**
```markdown
Title: I built a marketplace where devs keep 90% of sales (feedback wanted)

Hey r/SideProject!

I've been working on MyWork for the past few months. It's an AI-powered
framework + marketplace where developers can:

1. Build projects faster with AI assistance
2. Contribute to a shared "Brain" that gets smarter
3. Sell their work and keep 90%

**Why 90%?** App stores take 30%. Envato takes up to 37.5%.
I think creators deserve more.

**Tech stack:** Next.js, FastAPI, Claude AI, Stripe Connect

Looking for feedback on:
- Does this solve a real problem for you?
- What would make you try it?
- Pricing: $49/mo for sellers - too high/low?

GitHub: [link]
Demo: [link]

Happy to answer any questions!

```

**First Comment (from maker):**
```
Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], and I built MyWork because I was frustrated seeing developers'
amazing side projects gather dust on GitHub.

The problem: We can BUILD anything, but MONETIZING is hard.
App stores take 30%. Envato takes up to 37.5%. Gumroad isn't dev-focused.

So I built a marketplace BY developers, FOR developers:
- Open source framework (free forever)
- AI tools to build faster
- Marketplace to sell your work
- You keep 90%

The secret sauce is the "Brain" - a collective knowledge system that gets
smarter as more people use it. Think Stack Overflow meets AI.

I'd love your feedback on:
1. Does this solve a real problem?
2. What features would you want?
3. Would you sell your projects here?

Happy to answer anything! 🚀
```

## Week 6: Hacker News Launch

### Timing
- Best: Weekday morning (EST)
- Avoid: Weekends, holidays
- Post around 8-9 AM EST

### Post Formats

**Show HN (for launch):**
```
Title: Show HN: MyWork – AI framework + marketplace where devs keep 90%

I built a development framework with a twist: there's a marketplace
where you can sell what you build, and you keep 90% of sales.

The core idea: developers are great at building but terrible at
monetizing. App stores take 30%, Envato up to 37.5%. I think
creators deserve more.

Key features:
- Open source framework (MIT)
- AI-assisted development
- "Brain" - collective knowledge that learns
- Marketplace with 10% platform fee

Tech: Next.js, FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Claude AI, Stripe Connect

GitHub: https://github.com/DansiDanutz/MyWork-AI

Looking for feedback. What would make you use this?
```

**Tips for HN:**
1. Don't be salesy
2. Be technical and honest
3. Respond to EVERY comment
4. Accept criticism gracefully
5. Have technical answers ready

### Potential Questions & Answers

| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| "How do you make money at 10%?" | Volume + low costs (AI reduces support), subscriptions for premium features |
| "What stops people copying?" | Nothing - it's open source. Our moat is the Brain + network effects |
| "Why would I use this over Gumroad?" | Dev-focused, AI tools, collective learning |
| "Is this just another marketplace?" | No - it's framework + marketplace + AI knowledge system |
