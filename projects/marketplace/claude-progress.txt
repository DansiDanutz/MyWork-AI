# MyWork Marketplace - Development Progress

## Session: 2025-01-25 (Feature Database Mismatch Identified)

---

## CRITICAL ISSUE: Feature Database Project Mismatch

**Problem**: The feature database (`features.db`) contains features from a **gaming platform** project, NOT the MyWork Marketplace project.

**Evidence**:
- Feature #15: "Subscriber can create Credits game room" (Room Management - gaming)
- Feature #16-25: All about game lobbies, invitations, players kicking, etc.
- These features reference "Credits", "game rooms", "lobby", "match screens"

**Actual Project**: MyWork Marketplace is an **e-commerce platform** for selling code, SaaS templates, and development projects.

**Resolution**: Feature #15 was skipped (moved to priority 61) as it's not applicable.

## Dashboard Structure

**Existing Pages**:
- `/dashboard` - Overview page
- `/my-products` - Product CRUD (list, create, edit)
- `/orders` - Sales/orders for sellers
- `/purchases` - Purchase history for buyers
- `/payouts` - Payouts management (placeholder)

**Missing Pages** (from app_spec.txt):
- `/dashboard/settings` - Profile and account settings
- `/dashboard/analytics` - Revenue charts, sales analytics
- `/dashboard/brain` - Knowledge contributions
- `/checkout/[productId]` - Checkout flow
- `/checkout/success` - Order confirmation

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate**: Need to identify or create appropriate feature definitions for the MyWork Marketplace.

**Logical Next Feature**: Dashboard Settings Page
- Profile settings form (name, email, avatar)
- Seller profile settings (display name, bio)
- Notification preferences
- Connected accounts (Stripe Connect)
- Account deletion

## Database vs Reality

**Feature Database**: 56 features from gaming platform project
- Categories: Room Management, Invitation System, Gameplay, etc.
- Features about: Credits, game rooms, lobbies, players, matches

**Actual Project Requirements** (from app_spec.txt):
- Dashboard Products (management, CRUD)
- Dashboard Orders (sales, refunds)
- Dashboard Payouts (Stripe Connect)
- Dashboard Analytics (charts, metrics)
- Dashboard Brain (knowledge sharing)
- Dashboard Settings (profile, account)
- Checkout Flow (Stripe payment)
- Search & Filter (category, price, tech stack)
- File Upload (images, packages)

**Recommendation**: The feature database needs to be regenerated for the MyWork Marketplace project, or agents should work directly from app_spec.txt requirements.
