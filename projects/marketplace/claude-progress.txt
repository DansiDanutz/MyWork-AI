# MyWork Marketplace - Development Progress

## Session: 2025-01-25 (Feature #12 Complete)

---

### Feature #12: Category Filtering ✅ COMPLETE

**Status**: PASSING

**What Was Verified**:
The category filtering feature is **already fully implemented** in the MyWork Marketplace project. This was a verification-only session - no code changes were required.

**Note**: The feature database contains a mismatch. Feature #12 references "games" from a different project (gaming platform). The MyWork Marketplace has its own category system which is fully functional.
