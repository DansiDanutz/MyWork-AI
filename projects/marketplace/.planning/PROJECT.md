# MyWork Marketplace

> **You Build. You Share. You Sell.**

## Vision

Create the world's first AI-powered development marketplace where developers can:
1. Build production-ready projects with AI assistance
2. Contribute to a shared knowledge Brain
3. Monetize their work through a trusted marketplace

## Problem Statement

- **Developers** have side projects but no easy path to monetization
- **Buyers** want production-ready solutions without building from scratch
- **Existing platforms** don't combine AI tools + marketplace
- **Knowledge is siloed** - same problems solved repeatedly

## Solution

An integrated platform that:
1. Provides AI-powered development tools (free)
2. Accumulates collective intelligence (Brain)
3. Enables project sales (marketplace)
4. Fair economics (90% to creators)

## Target Users

### Primary: Indie Developers
- Solo devs with side projects
- Freelancers with reusable code
- Agency developers

### Secondary: Buyers
- Startups needing MVPs fast
- SMBs wanting ready solutions
- Enterprises seeking verified vendors
