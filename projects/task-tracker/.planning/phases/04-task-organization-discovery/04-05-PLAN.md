<objective>
Verify Phase 4 completion through human testing of all organization and
discovery features

Purpose: Confirm that all Phase 4 success criteria are met through end-to-end
testing of tag management, search, and filtering functionality.

Output: Verified working feature set, identified bugs documented, phase marked
complete.

  <what-built>
Complete task organization and discovery system:

- Tag model with many-to-many task relations
- PostgreSQL full-text search with tsvector and GIN indexes
- Fuzzy search fallback using pg_trgm
- Tag management UI (create, assign, remove tags)
- Search bar with 300ms debounce
- Filter sidebar with status and tag filters
- URL-based filter state (shareable/bookmarkable)
- Empty states with helpful guidance

  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Start the development server if not running:

```bash
cd /Users/dansidanutz/Desktop/MyWork/projects/task-tracker
npm run dev

```yaml

**1. Tag Management (TASK-05: User can organize tasks into categories)**

a) Create task with tags:

   - Visit <http://localhost:3000/tasks/new>
   - Enter title: "Test task with tags"
   - In the "Tags" field, type "work" and press Enter (creates new tag)
   - Type "urgent" and press Enter (creates another tag)
   - Click "Create Task"
   - Verify: Task is created and shows both tags

b) Edit task tags:

   - Click "Edit" on the task you just created
   - In the Tags field, click X on "urgent" to remove it
   - Type "feature" and press Enter to add a new tag
   - Click "Save Changes"
   - Verify: Task now shows "work" and "feature" tags, not "urgent"

c) Tag autocomplete:

   - Create another task
   - In the Tags field, type "wo"
   - Verify: "work" appears in dropdown (existing tag)
   - Select it from dropdown
   - Verify: Tag is added without creating duplicate

**2. Search (TASK-07: User can search tasks by content)**

a) Search by title:

   - Visit <http://localhost:3000/tasks>
   - In search bar, type "test"
   - Verify: Tasks with "test" in title appear (after ~300ms delay)
   - Verify: URL updates to include ?q=test
   - Verify: Result count shows below search bar

b) Search by description:

   - Create a task with title "Important meeting" and description "discuss

```text
 project roadmap"

```

   - Search for "roadmap"
   - Verify: The task appears in results (searches description too)

c) Fuzzy search:

   - Search for "meating" (typo of "meeting")
   - Verify: Task with "meeting" still appears (fuzzy matching)

d) Clear search:

   - Click the X button in search bar
   - Verify: Search clears, all tasks show again
   - Verify: URL ?q= param is removed

**3. Filtering (TASK-08: User can filter tasks by status, category, date)**

a) Status filter:

   - In the filter sidebar, check "To Do"
   - Verify: Only TODO tasks show
   - Check "In Progress" as well
   - Verify: Both TODO and IN_PROGRESS tasks show (OR logic within status)
   - Verify: URL includes ?status=TODO&status=IN_PROGRESS

b) Tag filter:

   - Uncheck all status filters
   - Check the "work" tag filter
   - Verify: Only tasks tagged with "work" show

c) Combined filters:

   - Check "To Do" status AND "work" tag
   - Verify: Only TODO tasks with "work" tag show (AND logic between filter

```text
 types)

```yaml

d) Clear filters:

   - Click "Clear all" in filter sidebar
   - Verify: All filters reset, all tasks show
   - Verify: URL params are cleared

**4. Empty States (Success Criteria #5)**

a) No search results:

   - Search for "xyznonexistent123"
   - Verify: "No tasks found" empty state appears
   - Verify: "Clear all filters" button is shown
   - Click "Clear all filters"
   - Verify: Tasks reappear

b) No tasks with filter:

   - If you have no DONE tasks, check only "Done" status
   - Verify: Empty state appears with helpful message

**5. URL Persistence**

a) Copy URL with filters:

   - Apply a search query and some filters
   - Copy the full URL from browser
   - Open in new tab or incognito
   - Verify: Same filters are applied on page load

**6. Mobile Responsiveness**

a) Resize browser to mobile width (<1024px):

   - Verify: Filter sidebar collapses into "Filters" dropdown
   - Click "Filters" to expand
   - Verify: Filters are accessible in collapsed form
   - Apply filters and verify they work

**7. Task Cards Display Tags**

a) View task list:

   - Verify: Task cards show tag badges with colors
   - If task has >3 tags, verify "+N more" text shows

**Report any issues found.**

  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all tests pass, or describe any issues

Phase 4 success criteria from ROADMAP.md:

1. User can organize tasks into categories or projects - TESTED via tag

management

2. User can search tasks by title, description, or content - TESTED via search
3. User can filter tasks by status, category, or date - TESTED via filters
4. Search and filter results update instantly - TESTED via debounced search and

immediate filter updates

5. Empty states show helpful guidance when no tasks match filters - TESTED via

empty states

</verification>

<success_criteria>
All Phase 4 requirements verified:

- TASK-05: User can organize tasks into categories or projects
- TASK-07: User can search tasks by title, description, or content
- TASK-08: User can filter tasks by status, category, or date

Human tester confirms:

- Tag creation and management works
- Search finds tasks by title and description
- Fuzzy search handles typos
- Status filters work correctly
- Tag filters work correctly
- Combined filters work (AND between types, OR within type)
- Empty states provide helpful guidance
- URL state persists across sessions
- Mobile responsive filters work

</success_criteria>

<output>
After human approval, create
`.planning/phases/04-task-organization-discovery/04-05-SUMMARY.md` documenting
verification results.

Then update:

1. ROADMAP.md - Mark Phase 4 plans as complete
2. STATE.md - Update current phase status

</output>
