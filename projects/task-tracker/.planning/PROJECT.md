# Task Tracker - Framework Validation Project

## What This Is

A simple task management application that serves as a proof-of-concept for the
MyWork framework's ability to produce production-ready applications. Users can
create, manage, and organize tasks with file attachments, while the system
captures reusable patterns for the collective brain.

## Core Value

**Validate that the MyWork framework can deliver production-quality applications
with reusable modules that accelerate future development.** Every feature built
must prove genuine user value and technical reusability for the brain.

## Requirements

### Validated

(None yet — ship to validate)

### Active

- [ ] Users can create accounts and authenticate securely
- [ ] Users can create, edit, and delete tasks
- [ ] Users can attach files to tasks
- [ ] Users can organize tasks with basic categorization
- [ ] Users can search and filter tasks
- [ ] System integrates with GitHub for tracking usage patterns
- [ ] Application is deployed and accessible for real user testing
- [ ] All features demonstrate measurable user engagement

### Out of Scope

- Real-time collaboration — Focus on individual productivity first
- Complex project management features — Keep it simple for validation
- Mobile app — Web-first approach for faster development
- Advanced permissions — Single-user focus initially
- Integrations with external task tools — Standalone validation

## Context

This project exists to validate the MyWork framework's capability to:

1. **Generate production-ready code** that users actually want to use
2. **Capture reusable patterns** for authentication, CRUD operations, file
handling, and UI components
3. **Demonstrate the brain learning system** by tracking which patterns survive
in real usage
4. **Prove the value proposition** for the future marketplace platform

The task tracker serves as the seed data for the brain - every working pattern
becomes an asset for future users. GitHub integration will track long-term
pattern success.

## Constraints

- **Timeline**: Ship working MVP quickly to start validation cycle
- **Tech Stack**: Use MyWork framework defaults for consistency
- **Simplicity**: Every feature must be genuinely useful, no feature bloat
- **GitHub Integration**: Mandatory connection for usage tracking
- **Real Usage**: Must be deployed and accessible for actual user testing
- **Quality**: Code quality must meet reusability standards for brain capture
