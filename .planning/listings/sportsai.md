## Long Description

### Turn Sports Betting Into Risk-Free Profit

SportsAI is a production-ready platform that automatically detects arbitrage
opportunities across 10+ sportsbooks in real-time. When bookmakers disagree on
odds, you win regardless of the outcome.

### How It Works

The platform uses a mathematical formula to find guaranteed profit
opportunities:

```text
text
Arbitrage % = (1/Odds_A) + (1/Odds_B) - 1
If negative = Guaranteed profit

```text
text

When sportsbooks have different opinions, you can bet on all outcomes and lock
in profit before the event even starts.

### Core Features
